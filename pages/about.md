# About

The Combating Bias Toolkit is designed to help AI/ML practitioners and managers identify,
understand, and mitigate sources of bias in their data, algorithms, and processes. This toolkit
is being made available publicly to disseminate tools and resources as broadly as possible
and to encourage teams across the federal government to contribute their own work for
inclusion. The toolkit is currently in Beta and is expected to grow as new opportunities emerge
to add tools and resources.

This toolkit was originally funded by the <a href="https://10x.gsa.gov" target="_blank">10x Program</a> at the General Services Administration and developed by xD at the U.S. Census Bureau to promote best practices and the usage of
practical, open-source tools to meaningfully address bias in government data and algorithms.

To contribute resources or case studies, learn more, or for more information about this
project or [xD](https://www.xd.gov), please reach out to email [inquiries@xd.gov](mailto:inquiries@xd.gov).
