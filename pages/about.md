# About

The Combating Bias Toolkit is designed to help practitioners and managers understand, plan, identify, and mitigate sources of bias in their data and algorithms. This toolkit is being made available publicly to disseminate tools and resources as broadly as possible and to encourage teams across the federal government to contribute their own work for inclusion. The toolkit is currently in Beta and is expected to grow as new opportunities emerge to add tools and resources.

This toolkit was originally funded by the 10x Program at the General Services Administration and developed by xD at the U.S. Census Bureau to promote best practices and the usage of practical, open-source tools to meaningfully address bias in government data and algorithms.

To contribute resources or case studies, learn more, or for more information about this project or [xD](https://www.xd.gov), please reach out to [inquiries@xd.gov](mailto:inquiries@xd.gov).
